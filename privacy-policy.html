  <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
  <p>

    To provide advertising services, the App may integrate third-party advertising SDKs (such as Google AdMob).
    These third parties may collect device information (model, OS version, advertising ID, IP address) and app
    usage data (session duration, ad interactions).
